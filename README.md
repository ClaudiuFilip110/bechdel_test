# Bechdel Test

This repo contains the necessary files for the Bechdel task explained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTvVD1v0MoF-s1eIOrWo1ahODMF83q1IMU76wxFK2FEbPuxKIFEk7EA_3gtdyMQmcvlL1tXgeL-R3Xc/pub?urp=gmail_link)

The main files are

## book_scraping.ipynb

This contains all the exploratory parts of the assignment, along with visualisations and trail and errors.

## run_book.py

This is a condensed script. Run this with this command
'''
python3 run_book.py HTML_FILE
'''

example: `python3 run_book.py 8MM.html`

There is no need to add the whole path to the file, just the name of the script itself.
